<div class="info-section" id="info-age">
    <h2>Age Discrimination</h2>
    <p>Age discrimination occurs when individuals are treated unfairly due to their age. This form of discrimination can affect both younger and older people. For instance, older adults may be denied job opportunities or promotions based on stereotypes that they are not technologically savvy or adaptable, while younger individuals may be dismissed as inexperienced or not taken seriously in professional environments. This bias can lead to significant barriers in the workplace and society, ultimately impacting individuals' self-esteem and economic stability.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section" id="info-gender">
    <h2>Gender Discrimination</h2>
    <p>Gender discrimination involves treating someone unfairly based on their gender. This form of discrimination often disproportionately affects women, who may face unequal pay, limited career advancement opportunities, and harassment in various settings. Moreover, gender-diverse individuals may experience exclusion or hostility simply for expressing their identity. Societal norms and expectations often perpetuate gender stereotypes, leading to systemic inequities that hinder personal and professional growth. Awareness and advocacy are crucial for challenging these biases and promoting equality.</p>
</div>

<div class="info-section" id="info-racial">
    <h2>Racial Discrimination</h2>
    <p>Racial discrimination refers to the unfair treatment of individuals based on their race or ethnicity. This discrimination can manifest in various ways, including systemic racism, where certain racial groups are disadvantaged in access to education, employment, healthcare, and legal rights. Prejudiced assumptions and stereotypes about racial groups can lead to social stigmas and can hinder individuals from fully participating in society. Recognizing and combating racial discrimination is vital for creating a just and equitable society for all individuals, regardless of their racial background.</p>

</div>

<div class="info-section" id="info-socialClass">
    <h2>Social Class Discrimination</h2>
    <p>Social class discrimination occurs when individuals are treated unfairly based on their socioeconomic status.
